"00:00";"In this video, I will show you how to provision the required services to build
 a basic but professional data platform in Azure.
This is a basic video and it will be used as the basis for further videos. 
To reproduce this tutorial, you will need an azure subscription. In case you don’t have one please google it to create one. 
To create an Azure Synapse workspace, the user must have Azure Contributor role and User Access Administrator permissions, or the Owner role in the subscription.
To start, go to the synapse analytics documentation page. You can google it or find the link in the video description."
"00: 16";"First, we are going to provision a synapse analytics workspace. There are many ways to do it in the documentation. We are going to use an Azure Resource Manager Template or ARM. In a future video we are going to discuss this topic in more detail."
"00:27";"In the Basic tab select your subscription. Then, use and existing group or create a new resource group.
I recommend you a new resource group that you can delete after following a tutorial.
Select the region you usually use or one close to your geographical location.
Add a workspace name.
For a synapse workspace you will need a storage account ADLS Gen 2. In this tutorial we will create 
a new one inside the workspace. If you use an existing account additional configuration steps are required. "
"01:06";"Remember only lowercase letters and numbers are valid for storage account names."
"01:15";"Enter the administrator username for the SQL Server.
Enter the administrator password for the SQL Server.
Let's use the default values for the remaining configuration and click on Review + create."
"01:35";"Finally, review again the details you have entered and press on Create. "
"01:43";"The provisioning process takes a few minutes."
"01:54";"Navigate to the resource group. A synapse workspace was created together with a storage account, where the catalog data and metadata of the workspace is stored."
"02:06";"Now click on the workspace to open the synapse studio."
"02:12";"The workspace sections and functionalities are material for another video."
"02:23";"By now, navigate to the Data tab. We are going to create a new SQL dedicated pool formerly known as Azure Data Warehouse."
"02:31";"As for every azure resource we must provide a name.
We also are going to select the lowest Performance level to minimize cost.
We can visualize the estimated price per hour."
"02:42";"In the Additional settings you can restore a database backup or use a restore point. 
For our tutorial let's select None and go to the next section."
"02:47";"Skip the tags this time."
"02:53";"Finally, click on create."
"02:59";"The provisioning process takes a few minutes."
"03:06";"Let's have a look again in our resource group."
"03:17";"We have also provisioned a SQL dedicated pool."
"03:22";"One important component of a basic data platform is a key vault to securely and easily manage
keys, secrets and certificates."
"03:30";"Let's add an azure key vault."
"03:45";"Place it in the same resource group."
"04:01";"Provide a name and a region. Also leave the Standard price tier."
"04:08";"Press on "review + create" and finally on create."
"04:27";"The azure key vault was correctly provisioned."
"04:32";"The last piece of our basic setup is creating a spark pool using synapse studio."
"04:36";"Enter a name for the pool.
Select Memory Optimized as the node size family.
Select the small node size. This should be enough for demo purposes. Leave the other values as default.
Notice the cluster will auto scale from 3 to 10 nodes. The estimated price is shown on the bottom.
Press on next for additional settings."
"04:57";"In the additional settings we can configure an automatic pausing which is a handy feature to 
pause the cluster when it is idle, so we can save money.
The details of the software available in the cluster is also listed on this screen."
"05:04";"Skip the tags."
"05:08";"Finally press on create."
"05:32";"All required services are created. Let's make a small smoke test with the sql pool."
"05:49";"In the data tab we can find the SQL dedicated pool we have created. As you can see, the database is empty."
"05:55";"Let's create a SQL script."
"06:03";"If you do it from the Tables clicking on the three periods, the sql script will contain a skeleton for a table.
Please note that in a dedicated pool the table definition must have a distribution."
"06:08";"We are going to change the table name, add an auto incremental key and another dummy column."
"06:26";"Provide a name for the script."
"06:33";"We are ready to go, let's run our query."
"06:46";"our table was successfully created."
"06:51";"we can also create and store sql scripts in the develop tab."
"07:02";"Provide a name for the script and create a couple of dummy records."
"07:23";"Ooops, we have not selected our demo database."
"07:42";"time to check our results!"
"07:57";"Great! The records were inserted correctly."
"08:03";"Now we have finished a minimal setup of our data platform a performed a smoke test for the sql dedicated pool. Of course, there are many things to set like restrict IP addresses which are able to connect to the database, add users with different Synapse roles, configure access to other data sources, etc. We have also not explained every section of the synapse studio in detail."
"08:09";"As a bonus section let's connect to the sql pool using azure data studio."
"08:16";"The server name is the concatenation of the workspace name and the string “.sql.azuresynapse.net” (without port number)."
"08:42";"Remember the SQL user we created while provisioning the workspace?
Select SQL Login and enter the user name and password."
"09:02";"The connection works and the available table is listed."
"09:11";"Let's check queries are working."
"09:14";"And that's all for today, hope you like the video."
